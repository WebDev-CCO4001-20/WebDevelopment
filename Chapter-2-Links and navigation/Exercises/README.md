# Chapter 2 Exercises

Exercises under the heading **Assessment Exercises** must be completed as part of the Set Exercises assessment. You will find additional optional exercises which can be completed to gain higher marks. 

For each exercise you should create a new project with the name of the exercise and save it to this exercises folder in your local repository. Once you have completed your solution you should make sure you commit and push your solutions to your remote repository on GitHub. You can commit and push as many changes to your solutions as you wish; only those pushed before the chapter deadlines will be marked for the Programming Skills Portfolio.

## Assessment Exercises 

### Relative Paths :ballot_box_with_check:

Consider the file structure of the following project: 

![image](https://github.com/nigelfryatt/webDevelopment-CCO4001-20/blob/main/Chapter-2-Links%20and%20navigation/Exercises/relativePaths.jpg?raw=true)

You can see that within our root directory (relativePaths) we have an index.html file, two subdirectories (files and img), a further two subdirectories within img (banners and main), and a further two subdirectories within files (cart and pages). 

For each of the following write an anchor tag (using a relative URL) that would link from A to B. For each of the links use "relative URL" as the text value. Save links into a file called index.html.

* A: index.html B: first.html
* A: third.html B: two.jpg
* A: cart.html  B: index.html
* A: cart.html  B: banner.jpg

### One-page website :ballot_box_with_check:

Pick a television series, film or game and design a really simple one-page website (just text, no images). Your website should include:

* An overview of the plot, key information, cast and/or creative team, characters and any reviews you can find. 
* A nav bar at the top which allows the user to quickly navigate to sections further down the page (anchor Ids).
* A link to the actual website of the film/game etc. which opens in a new tab when clicked. 
* Use of an external CSS file to style elements creatively (avoid inline styling and use classes instead).
* At least two classes. 
* One link styled as a button.

## Bonus Assessment Exercises:

### Multi-page website

Using the one-page website you created, clone it into a new directory and split the information down into a simple multi-page website.

* An individual page for: plot, key information, cast and/or creative team, characters and any reviews you can find. 
* Put your new pages in a subdirectory called "pages".
* Ensure that each page has a navigation bar.
